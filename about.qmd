## About me

Hi!

I am currently conducting a PhD at the University of Bari Aldo Moro in collaboration with CNR-ISPC. My research interests mainly concern the application of quantitative and computer science methods to archaeology, with a specific focus on the application of unsupervised learning methods to ceramics.

#### Research Interests

- Quantitative approach in archaeology
- Bronze and Iron Age
- Machine Learning application in archaeology
- GIS application in archaeology
