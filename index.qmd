## About me

***Hi!***

I am currently conducting a PhD at the University of Bari Aldo Moro (PhD course in *Patrimoni archeologici, storici architettonici e paesaggistici mediterranei*) in collaboration with CNR-ISPC. My research interests mainly concern the application of quantitative and computer science methods to archaeology, with a specific focus on the application of unsupervised learning methods to ceramics.

#### Research Interests

-   Quantitative approach in archaeology
-   Bronze and Iron Age
-   Machine Learning application in archaeology
-   GIS application in archaeology
